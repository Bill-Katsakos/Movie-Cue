# Movie-Cue

Movie-Cue is a MERN stack MVP web application that allows users to create and manage their personal movie watchlist. With JWT-based authentication, users can sign up, log in, and safely manage their account. The app enables users to perform CRUD operations on movies, including storing titles, posters, release years, and their watched status. Additionally, Movie-Cue integrates with the OMDB API for movie searches, letting users easily add new titles to their list and mark them as watched or unwatched.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT (sign-up, log in, log out)
- Search movies or TV series using the OMDB API
- Add movies/series to a personal watchlist
- Mark movies/series as watched or unwatched
- Remove movies/series from the watchlist
- "Surprise Me" feature to suggest a random unwatched movie
